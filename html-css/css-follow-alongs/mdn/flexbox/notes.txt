flexbox has two axes, (axises lol)
main axis and cross axis

flex direction has four possible values which define the main and cross axis

row, row-reverse, column, and column reverse

in row and row-reverse, the main axis goes from left and right and the cross axis goes up and down
in column and column-reverse, the main axis goes up and down and the cross axis goes left and right

start and end differs depending on the working language.
in english it starts on the left and goes towards the right.
in arabic (for example) it starts on the right and goes towards the left.

flex-wrap, wrap or nowrap. wrap = boxes will wrap and maintain a certain size. nowrap = boxes will shrink to fit the container
