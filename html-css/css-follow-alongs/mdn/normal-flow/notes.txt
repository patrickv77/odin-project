you cant change width and height of inline elements. you must change their display property with display: block or display: inline-block in order to change
the width and height.

overlapping margins of *VERTICALLY* adjacent elements have what is called margin collapsing.
the larger margin is taken and the smaller margin disappears. (if they are even then the margin is just one not both).
